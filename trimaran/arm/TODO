- Move the shift-dp combination stuff back into the elcor pattern matcher.

- Long long support

- Fix benchmarks that classical optis break

- Smarter constant creation in codegen. That is, codegen creates a
load if a constant is not supported by the instruction set. Sometimes
it's faster to use two data processing instructions (shifts and ors)
to create that constant instead. This is why gcc kicks our butt on
md5.
