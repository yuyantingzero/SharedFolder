The following toplevel HPL-PD mdes files are supported in this directory.

hpl_pd_elcor_std.hmdes2
	Standard hpl_pd/elcor machine description files by Shail Aditya
	with programmable Int, Float, Mem, Branch Units.

hpl_pd_elcor_seq.hmdes2
	Sequential hpl_pd/elcor machine description files by Shail Aditya
	single issue with one Int, Float, Mem, Branch Units each.


w?l?.hmdes2
	The files, w1l1.hmdes2 through w4l4.hmdes2 are a collection
	of machine models with four combinations of widths (w1, w2, w3, w4)
	and four combinations of latencies (l1, l2, l3, l4) that were
	generated by Santosh with help from Mike and Vinod.

	Only the *.hmdes2 files are in CVS; generate the lmdes2 files
	using hc <hmdes2_file_name> before using these machine models.
	
	The width combinations are:
	# of	Int	Float	Mem	Branch
	units

	w1 is	1	1	1	1
	w2 is	2	2	2	1
	w3 is	4	2	2	1
	w4 is	4	4	4	1

	The latency combinations are:
	Latency Int	Float	Int/Flt	Int/Flt	Load	Store	Branch
	of	ALU	Add	Mul	Div

	l1 is	1	1	1	4	1	1	1
	l2 is	1	3	3	8	2	1	1
	l3 is	2	4	4	12	3	1	1
	l4 is	5	6	10/12	15/16	5	3	3

	These canned machines models simplify the process of setting up
	experiments that require multiple machine models.
	The use of these machine models will also enable comparison across
	different experiments.

i?m?.hmdes2	July 9, 1996	Santosh
	These models are for the pico cvliw experiments.
	The latency model is set to l2, as described above.
	The number of float  units is 4.
	The number of branch units is 1.
	The integer width combinations are 1, 2, 4, 8 respy
		for i1m*, i2m*, i4m*, i8m*
	The memory width combintations are 1, 2, 4 respectively
		for *m1*, *m2*, *m4*.
