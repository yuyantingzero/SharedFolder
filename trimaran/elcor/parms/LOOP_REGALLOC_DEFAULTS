(Elcor_Loop_regalloc declaration

    # Perform wand_only allocation, that is, allocation only for the
    # steady-state part of the loop. Wand-only allocation requires prolog and epilog
    # peeling after the allocation. The allocator can be queried to return the
    # required amount of peeling. Although the allocator provides this feature, we
    # don't use and support this feature in the compiler as it requires peeling.
    #   0 -- Not wand_only (with leading and trailing blades)
    #   1 -- wand_only
    #   0 is the default.
    rr_wand_only = 0;

    # To use open-loop or closed loop model of rotating registers.
    #   0 -- closed loop
    #   1 -- open loop
    # We provide both but I believe HPL-PD manual says it is open loop. In any
    # case open loop is default.
    rr_open_loop = 1;

    # r_pred_alloc: To do predicate-cognizant allocation or not.
    # 0 -- no
    # 1 -- yes
    # 1 is the default.
