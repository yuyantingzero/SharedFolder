Each party who contributes Software or makes a Derivative Work to this file
(hereafter, Contributed Code) represents to each Licensor and to other

LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED BY THE USERS OF THE SOFTWARE OR DERIVATIVE
WORKS.

Any Licensee wishing to make commercial use of the Software or Derivative
Works should contact each and every Licensor to negotiate an appropriate
license for such commercial use, and written permission of all Licensors will
be required for such a commercial license.  Commercial use includes (1)
integration of all or part of the source code into a product for sale by or on
behalf of Licensee to third parties, or (2) distribution of the Software or
